&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slight stylistic &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; change (finally know which &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; to fix)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixing &lt;code&gt;jQuery&lt;/code&gt; plugin for returning search results properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is enough material I will blog about how to customize different
parts of this statically generated blog using &lt;code&gt;Pelican&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the things
that I wish to learn in grad. school (besides Physics and Cosmology
obviously), Bayesian stat. and PGMs are some things that I have wanted to
learn about for a long time.
I believe a better understanding
of probabilistic models / stat. concepts will aid my data analysis tremendously. 
Therefore, I have stopped giving myself excuses and started working on the Coursera material on &lt;a href="https://class.coursera.org/pgm-003"&gt;Probabilistic Graphical
Model (PGM)&lt;/a&gt;. i&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related reading that I assigned myself include: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Probabilistic Graphical Model Principles and
Techniques" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412Q24g5bGL.jpg" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
which is the course textbook.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bayesian Reasoning and Machine
Learning (aka my new favorite
book)" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mDqNeDjxL.jpg" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
which is one of my favorite textbooks with really concrete examples and
accompanying code &lt;code&gt;BRMLToolKit&lt;/code&gt; which is written in &lt;code&gt;Matlab&lt;/code&gt;. 
As programming exercises, I have been trying to rewrite some of the code in Python
&lt;a href="https://github.com/karenyyng/PyBRMLToolKit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Building Probabilistic Graphical Models with
Python" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/611O8b3PxDL.jpg" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I am curious to see how good the &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; package &lt;code&gt;libpgm&lt;/code&gt; is which is used in this
book. Now I don't know
how good the statistics / probability part of the book is but I am willing to
give the python package a try without reinventing
everything from scratch if it is good.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, since most of the books above contain mostly machine learning /
probability concepts, I am adding one last book to the list to gain more
perspective from the statistics side of things. It is written by one of
my favorite (Bayesian) statisticians Andrew Gelman. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Data Analysis using Regression and Multilevel / Hierarchical
Models" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519gJUTbWwL.jpg" /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other things that I wish to do later in grad. school such as
actually practise doing data analysis with &lt;a href="http://www.kaggle.com/competitions"&gt;Kaggle
competitions&lt;/a&gt; but I should focus!
I am giving myself half a year's time from now just to learn as much about PGM /
Bayesian stat. related stuff as possible before diving into Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">K. Y.
